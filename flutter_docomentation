Getting Started with Flutter? Master These Key Terminologies First!

When I started with Flutter, the toughest part wasnâ€™t coding â€“ it was understanding the terminologies.
 Here are some basics every Flutter dev should know:

ğŸ“Œ Widget â€“ The building block of everything in Flutter (UI + Logic).
 ğŸ“Œ StatelessWidget â€“ A widget that does not change once built.
 ğŸ“Œ StatefulWidget â€“ A widget that can change dynamically (with setState or state management).
 ğŸ“Œ BuildContext â€“ A reference to where your widget lives in the widget tree ğŸŒ³.
 ğŸ“Œ Hot Reload vs Hot Restart â€“ Speed up your development cycle âš¡.
 ğŸ“Œ MaterialApp / CupertinoApp â€“ App-level widgets for Android & iOS design.
 ğŸ“Œ Scaffold â€“ Provides basic UI structure (AppBar, Drawer, FAB, etc).
 ğŸ“Œ Navigator â€“ Handles screen routing & navigation ğŸ§­.
 ğŸ“Œ State Management â€“ How your app handles & updates data (Provider, Riverpod, BLoC, GetX).

ğŸ’¡ Mastering these terms makes Flutter much easier to learn and build with.
